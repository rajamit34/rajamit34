<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Amit Raj</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Data Analyst/ Business Analyst</h3>
As a dedicated and detail-oriented Data Analyst, I am passionate about utilizing my analytical and statistical skills to help organizations drive data-based decision-making. With a strong background in analytical tools and methodologies such as Excel, SQL, and Python. I am excited about the prospect of working with innovative technologies like Snowflake and Power BI.


I have hands-on experience in Data Gathering, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization, with an ability to identify patterns and trends, handle outliers and missing values, and find correlations between data sets. 

In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong soft skills such as critical thinking, time management, teamwork, and communication, which enable me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and deliver high-quality results in a timely manner.

I am currently seeking an opportunity to establish my career as a Data Analyst in a challenging and dynamic work environment that provides opportunities for growth, innovation, and professional development. If you are looking for someone with a passion for data and a commitment to excellence, please feel free to reach out to me.
